# Advent of Code 2018

My solutions to the advent of code puzzles in Rust.

## Structure

Each problem has it's own directory within which the README explains the problem
while the INPUT represents my given input set.

Each solution can be run using Rust 1.30 and above in the following manner:

```bash
cd day_x
cargo run < INPUT
```

## Index

1. [Day 1](/day_1)
2. [Day 2](/day_2)
3. [Day 3](/day_3)
4. [Day 4](/day_4)
